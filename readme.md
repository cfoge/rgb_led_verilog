An FPGA project writern in varilog designed to control RGB LEDs

Features:
8bit PWM control
Fade functionality (up and down, or just up)
16 fade/blinking speeds
blinking
preset colours


To do:
create direct controal over the brightness of an led, bypassing the fade function
create blink not fade function

combine 3 led drivers into one RGB led driver
use rom lookup table to drive colour of led
